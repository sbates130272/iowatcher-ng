Prerequisites are GCC, G++, Make, Bison, etc. - in Debian systems this is called the _build-essential_ package.
_Clang_ and its development headers, and _llvm_. Finally you can install _blktrace_.

== Preparing Fedora for installation of `Rustup`

sudo the following commands:

```bash

$ dnf install @development-tools cmake

$ dnf install g++ clang clang-devel llvm llvm-devel

$ dnf install blktrace
```

== Installing `Rustup`

1. Install `Rustup` as described [here](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Restart your shell, or source `$HOME/.cargo/env`.
3. Now you have `cargo` in path.

== Compiling project

1. Go to your project source directory root and execute `cargo build`.
2. This previous step shall download all dependencies and build the project libraries and executable binaries.

== Development environment

* Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* Install [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) `ext install rust-lang.rust-analyzer`
* Install [Docker for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) `ext install ms-azuretools.vscode-docker`
* Check out project repository in local.
* Open project repository root folder with _VSCode_.
